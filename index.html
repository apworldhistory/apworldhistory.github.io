									<h2 class="major">Shahadah</h2>
									<p>Shahadah means "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God." It reminds us that there is only one Creator, who sent messengers and revealed words of guidance to humans. Individually, each Muslim has a relationship with God. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Zakah</h2>
									<p>Zakah is not an option, it is a compulsory act for all Muslims. It is a contribution paid once a year on savings of two and a half percent. This giving is to “cleanse” your money and possessions from excessive desire for them or greed. The idea is, that by giving this money you learn not to place too much importance on material wealth.</p>
